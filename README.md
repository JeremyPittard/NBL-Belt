# NBL-Belt
the nbl belt
This is a small personal project I am working on where I will eventually be able to automatically track who currently holds the NBL belt,
I have done the hard yards and worked out manually who posses it for now (went back to the beginning of the league in 1979 and traced it)
I am now attempting to gain access to an api or find something that is scrapable then run a script to auto trace and display.
